This folder contains some scripts I use to automate the process of building SIGIL, as well as copying the appropriate libraries among the examples.

This is mainly just for my use only, since making changes to SIGIL would involve (before these scripts were available) opening and compiling all of these projects by hand, as well as copying the relevant libraries around as required. As you can imagine, this is quite the pain in the ass, so these scripts are meant to make my life easier.

Feel free to use these scripts if you wish, but they probably won't run right off the hop without installing the appropriate compilers. Again, these are unsupported and meant for my own use.
