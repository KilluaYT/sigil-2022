What is SIGIL?
--------------
SIGIL stands for Simple Input and Graphics Integration Library, and is meant to provide mind-bogglingly simple 2D graphics functions in C or C++. It is a great alternative to other, more complex graphics libraries when all you want is to make a simple game, teach basic graphics, or otherwise remove the complexity of graphics programming from your code.

Here is a simple example program to draw a rectangle and a line of text.

#include "sl.h"

int main(int args, char *argv[])
{
	// open a small window with a dark cyan background
	slWindow(500, 500, "Sigil Window");
	slSetBackColor(0.0, 0.5, 0.5);

	// main loop ends when user presses the 'X' close button
	while(!slShouldClose())
	{
		// prepare a simple rectangle
		slFillRectangle(250, 250, 50, 20);

		// print a simple message
		slSetTextAlign(SL_ALIGN_CENTER);
		slText(250, 250, "Hello world!");

		// show our scene
		slRender();
	}

	// and we're done!
	slClose();
	return 0;
}

Cool! What platforms does SIGIL support?
----------------------------------
Although plans are underway to make SIGIL fully cross-platform, it only supports Windows at the moment.

Where can I download SIGIL?
------------------------------
Currently, you can download pre-compiled libs for:
	MinGW 32-bit
	MinGW 64-bit
	MSVC 32-bit
	MSVC 64-bit

Each of the above links provides the required header file and static library. Source code is also available on Gitlab.

How do I use SIGIL?
-------------------
Using SIGIL in your program only requires you to #include "sl.h" and link against one of the provided static libraries. This will be either libsigil.a or sigil.lib depending on which compiler you use.

There is also helpful documentation describing the functions that SIGIL provides.

I have a feature request/bug report/helpful comment. Who do I contact?
