SIGIL comes with no official license. However, the project maintainer, Geoff, would like to ask that users of SIGIL do not use it:

	1) to promote their ridiculous religious and/or political beliefs
	2) to harm little bunnies and/or small children
	3) to fuel their campaign(s) for world domination (this includes benevolent dictatorships)

With all that nonsense out of the way, many of the libraries that SIGIL uses come with licenses of their own. So pay attention.
