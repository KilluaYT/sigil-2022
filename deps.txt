LIB          apt?             solution?

glfw3         no              provide source to build alongside
glew1.13      1.7             use find module
freetype2     yes             use find module
openal        yes             use find module
soil          yes             provide source in project


- clone glfw from git repo
- 

building from source:
- download and install glew
	- on windows, place glew.dll into project dir, and include into gl folder
	- on linux, do an apt-get install for glew
- download and install freetype
- do a cmake and a make and then you're done

precompiled:
- download and install glew
- download and install freetype
- download and install main lib

due to the difficulties of installing and compiling glfw, it makes more sense to *not* compile it as part of the project. it should be linked to, instead, from within the cmake project.
