BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE USING GCC IN LINUX
---------------------------------------------

SIGIL uses CMake to compile, so you will need to install it:

	sudo apt-get install cmake

Optionally, you may want to install a more visually-pleasing version of CMake. It's only really necessary when you run into CMake problems when trying to build SIGIL, so it's optional:

	sudo-apt-get install cmake-curses-gui

We depend on the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library:

	sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

Also install the FreeType 2 (FT2) Library:

	sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev

We need OpenAL for audio:

	sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev

If you want to develop SIGIL applications using CodeBlocks, and want to use the CodeBlocks output console (such as in debug mode), you should install xterm, too:

	sudo apt-get install xterm

Next, we can download the SIGIL source code from GitLab and build it.

		cd ~/
		sudo apt-get install git
		git clone git@gitlab.com:geoff-nagy/sigil.git
		cd sigil
		mkdir build-linux-gcc
		cd build-linux-gcc
		cmake ../
		make
		sudo make install

And you're done! Example projects for every supported compiler are provided in the "examples" folder.
