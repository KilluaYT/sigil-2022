BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE USING GCC IN LINUX
---------------------------------------------

SIGIL uses CMake to compile, so you will need to install it:

	sudo apt-get install cmake

Optionally, you may want to install a more visually-pleasing version of CMake. It's only really necessary when you run into CMake problems when trying to build SIGIL, so it's optional:

	sudo-apt-get install cmake-curses-gui

We depend on the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library:

	sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

We need OpenAL for audio:

	sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev

If you want to develop SIGIL applications using CodeBlocks, and want to use the CodeBlocks output console (such as in debug mode), you should install xterm, too:

	sudo apt-get install xterm

Next, we can download the SIGIL source code from GitLab.

	cd ~/
	sudo apt-get install git
	git clone https://gitlab.com/geoff-nagy/sigil.git

Navigate to SIGIL's root directory and type:

    cd deps

This is where CMake-based dependencies of SIGIL are located. We will use Git to acquire GLFW. (You can ignore the "pigu" and "freetype" folders.)

Type the following:

    git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git

Now back up into SIGIL's root directory and build everything:

	cd ../
	mkdir build-linux-gcc
	cd build-linux-gcc
	cmake ../
	make
	sudo make install

And you're done! Example projects for every supported compiler are provided in the "examples" folder.
