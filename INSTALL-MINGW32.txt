BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE USING MINGW IN WINDOWS
-------------------------------------------------

Pick a nice location for SIGIL. Using a command prompt, type

	git clone git@gitlab.com:geoff-nagy/sigil.git

to download the SIGIL source code.

This guide assumes that you're using the MinGW32 compiler provided by CodeBlocks (which is an ideal IDE choice if you're going to be compiling C/C++ applications using MinGW32). You will need to change some of the installation directories below if you're using a different approach.

SIGIL depends on the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library. Headers and pre-compiled libs are included with SIGIL in the /glew folder. Copy and paste the following files into the appropriate locations as below:

	/glew/lib/mingw32/libglew32.dll.a ---> C:/Program Files (x86)/CodeBlocks/MinGW/lib/libglew32.dll.a
	/glew/include/*.h                 ---> C:/Program Files (x86)/CodeBlocks/MinGW/include/GL/*.h

We also need to get a copy of the FreeType 2 (FT2) library. Download and run the "Complete package, except sources" installer from 

	http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm

to install FT2. If you plan to use CodeBlocks for your SIGIL projects, make sure that you install into

	C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW

and NOT

	C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\GnuWin32

or anywhere else, otherwise you may encounter difficulties when building SIGIL.

Next, we can start building SIGIL. Enter the root directory 'sigil' where you cloned the SIGIL source code and type:

	mkdir build-mingw32
	cd build-mingw32
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../
