BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE
--------------------------

1) SIGIL depends on a few libraries that need to be installed.

	The OpenGL Extension Wrangler library (GLEW):

		sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

	The FreeType 2 Library (FT2). Download and run the "Complete package, except sources" installer from

		http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm

	Make sure that you install FT2 into the correct directory. If you're using MinGW32 provided by CodeBlocks, then you should install into C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\

	The Open Audio Library (OpenAL). Download and run the "OpenAL 1.1 Windows Installer" from

		https://www.openal.org/downloads/

2) Next, we can download the SIGIL source code from GitLab and build it.

		cd [home_directory]
		git clone git@gitlab.com:geoff-nagy/sigil.git
		cd sigil
		mkdir build-mingw32
		cd build-mingw32
		cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../
		mingw32-make
		sudo make install

3) And you should be good to go!
