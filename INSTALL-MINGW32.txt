BUILDING SIGIL FROM SOURCE USING MINGW32 IN WINDOWS
---------------------------------------------------

If you haven't already, it's probaby a good idea to download the CodeBlocks IDE. This guide assumes that you'll be using the MinGW compiler provided by CodeBlocks to compile your code, and that you'll be using CodeBlocks to build your SIGIL applications. If this is not the case, some of the instructions and directories in this guide will need to be changed to reflect your approach. Download the "codeblocks-XX.XXmingw-setup.exe" binary release from:

	http://codeblocks.org/downloads/26

Next, download SIGIL. If you have git, you can use a command prompt:

	git clone git@gitlab.com:geoff-nagy/sigil.git

Otherwise, you can download the source code as a .zip file from:

	https://gitlab.com/geoff-nagy/sigil

SIGIL depends on the OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) library. Headers and pre-compiled libs are included with SIGIL in the /glew folder. Copy and paste the following files into the appropriate locations as below:

	sigil/glew/lib/mingw32/libglew32.dll.a    ---> C:/Program Files (x86)/CodeBlocks/MinGW/lib/libglew32.dll.a
	sigil/glew/include/GL/*.h                 ---> C:/Program Files (x86)/CodeBlocks/MinGW/include/GL/*.h

We also need to get a copy of the FreeType 2 (FT2) library. Download and run the "Complete package, except sources" installer from 

	http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/freetype.htm

to install FT2. If you plan to use CodeBlocks for your SIGIL projects, make sure that you install into

	C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW

and NOT

	C:\Program Files (x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\GnuWin32

or anywhere else, otherwise you may encounter difficulties when building SIGIL.

We need OpenAL for audio. Download the zipped OpenAL Soft Windows binaries ("openal-soft-X.XX.X-bin.zip") from

	http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html#download

and extract the contents of this zip folder somewhere (we will use the location "OAL"). Copy and paste the following files into the appropriate locations as below:

	OAL/openal-soft-X.XX.X-bin/libs/Win32/libOpenAL32.dll.a ---> C:/Program Files (x86)/CodeBlocks/MinGW/lib/libOpenAL32.dll.a
	OAL/openal-soft-X.XX.X-bin/include/AL/*.h               ---> C:/Program Files (x86)/CodeBlocks/MinGW/include/AL/*.h

Next, we can start building SIGIL. Enter the directory "sigil" (where you cloned the SIGIL source code) in a command prompt and type:

	mkdir build-mingw32
	cd build-mingw32
	cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../

Now, proceed with the build:

	mingw32-make

This will create the files

	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll
	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll.a

It's probably now a good idea to put all of the necessary DLLs and libsigil.a in a common location for you to copy into your SIGIL projects later on. This is the same process that we use when building and distributing SIGIL.

	OAL/openal-soft-X.XX.X-bin/bin/Win32/soft_oal.dll ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/soft_oal.dll
	sigil/glew/lib/mingw32/glew32.dll                 ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/glew32.dll
	sigil/glfw/lib/mingw32/glfw3.dll                  ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/glfw3.dll
	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll                  ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/libsigil.dll
	sigil/build-mingw32/libsigil.dll.a                ---> sigil/sigil-mingw32/lib/libsigil.dll.a
	sigil/include/sl.h                                ---> sigil/sl/sl.h

Now, please consult USING-SIGIL-MINGW32.txt for instructions on how to integrate SIGIL into your applications.
