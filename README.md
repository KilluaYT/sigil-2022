Sound, Input, and Graphics Integration Library (SIGIL)

A simple, minimalist library for playing audio, handling basic input, and drawing 2D graphics such as sprites, shapes, and text.

The CodeBlocks project file is not meant for compiling SIGIL. It only exists to make editing the source code easier. Building should be done as per the BUILD instructions in this directory.
