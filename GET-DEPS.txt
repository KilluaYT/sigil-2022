ACQUIRING SIGIL DEPENDENCIES PRIOR TO BUILDING IN WINDOWS
---------------------------------------------------------

After downloading SIGIL, navigate to SIGIL's root directory and type:

    cd deps

This is where CMake-based dependencies of SIGIL are located. We will use Git to acquire GLFW and Freetype2. (You can ignore the "pigu" folder---it is used for Raspberry Pi builds.)

Type the following:

    git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
    git clone http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git

And you're done. Continue with your build instructions as normal.
